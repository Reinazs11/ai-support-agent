# Known Limitations

- Uploaded files are stored on local disk only; there is no object storage,
  retention policy, or cleanup workflow yet.
- `/ingest/{document_id}` only generates embeddings and indexes vectors when
  the configured embedding provider is available. OpenAI works through
  `EMBEDDING_API_KEY` or the backward-compatible `OPENAI_API_KEY`; local
  embeddings are prepared in configuration but not implemented yet.
- `/chat` retrieves from Qdrant and can call an OpenAI chat model when
  configured. Current metadata filtering is limited to document IDs, context
  budgeting is character-based rather than token-aware, and cost estimates
  require configured per-token rates.
- Ticket classification is deterministic and keyword-based.
- The CLI evaluation runner is implemented for local deterministic RAG evals,
  but `/evals/run` still returns placeholder results and the committed dataset
  is intentionally small.
- Authentication, authorization, rate limits, and file retention are not implemented.
- Public deployment configuration is not complete.
