# AI Support & Knowledge Agent

A production-style AI Engineering portfolio project for building a support and
knowledge-base agent with document ingestion, RAG, vector search, evaluation,
observability, and controlled agentic workflows.

The goal is not to hide complexity behind a demo. The goal is to build the system
incrementally, with clear backend architecture, explicit contracts, measurable
quality, and honest documentation about what is complete and what is still planned.

## What This Project Will Support

- Document ingestion for company knowledge-base files.
- Parsing and chunking for `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`, and `.csv`.
- Embedding generation for semantic search.
- Vector storage in Qdrant.
- Metadata storage in PostgreSQL.
- RAG-based question answering with real sources and citations.
- Ticket or lead classification.
- Controlled agent workflows with human-in-the-loop boundaries.
- Automated RAG evaluation.
- Structured logs, latency tracking, cost tracking, and LLM tracing.
- Local execution with Docker Compose.
- Public deployment and demo documentation.

## Current Status

Phase 1, the project foundation, is in place. Phase 2 persistence is merged.
The first Phase 3 slice is being developed in a feature branch.

Implemented:

- FastAPI application structure.
- Environment-based settings.
- Structured logging setup.
- Initial HTTP contracts.
- Document upload metadata persistence and document chunk persistence.
- Placeholder endpoints for chat and evaluation.
- Deterministic services for chunking and initial ticket classification.
- SQLAlchemy model draft for the main domain entities.
- Docker Compose services for PostgreSQL and Qdrant.
- Architecture, API, evaluation, safety, and limitation docs.
- Initial pytest coverage.

Still pending:

- Object storage or durable file retention policy for uploaded documents.
- OpenAI embeddings.
- Qdrant indexing and retrieval.
- Real RAG answer generation.
- LangGraph agent workflow.
- Langfuse tracing.
- Deployment setup.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.12.10
- FastAPI and Pydantic v2
- PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy 2.x, and Alembic
- Qdrant for vector search
- OpenAI SDK for LLM and embedding calls
- LangGraph for agent workflows
- Langfuse for LLM observability
- PyMuPDF for PDF parsing
- Pytest for testing
- Ruff and mypy for code quality
- Docker Compose for local infrastructure

## Local Development

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install the project with development dependencies:

```powershell
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Create a local environment file:

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

Start local infrastructure:

```powershell
docker compose up -d postgres qdrant
```

Run the API:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Check the health endpoint:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Validation

Run the main checks before committing:

```powershell
python -m compileall app scripts tests
python -m pytest
python -m ruff check .
```

## Roadmap

The project follows the phases documented in
[`docs/implementation-plan.md`](docs/implementation-plan.md):

1. Foundation.
2. Persistence with SQLAlchemy and Alembic.
3. Document ingestion and embeddings.
4. RAG.
5. Evaluation.
6. Agent workflows.
7. Observability and deployment.

## Learning Focus

This project is designed for someone with backend experience who wants to learn
AI Engineering through a realistic system. Each phase should make the AI-specific
concepts explicit: chunking, embeddings, vector search, grounded generation,
citations, evaluation, cost, latency, and operational safety.
